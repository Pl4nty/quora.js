# dev: work-in-progress features

## DO NOT CLONE
WIPs are pushed here, this branch is almost guaranteed to be broken.
Even detailed feature requests can be added (eg pseudocode).

## Rules
1. Avoid commenting on code specifics eg syntax, comments, formatting - most features will undergo refactoring later
2. If reviewing, focus on architectural issues - these are easiest to fix now, before much code has been written
3. Pull requests to latest are accepted after a feature is passing with at least 50% coverage
